# Private-Research-Containers

This project was developed in partnership with BMD Software company and had as its primary objective the search for existing technological solutions that aim to improve the collaborative factor in the research area, and consequently create a new solution.

As a result, a web platform was developed to enable the creation of virtual and collaborative spaces for sharing and analyzing clinical research data. It is a system that meets strong security requirements, including two-factor authentication and protection of data copy by its users.
